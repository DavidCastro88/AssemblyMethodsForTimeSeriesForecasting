# AssemblyMethodsForTimeSeriesForecasting

In this paper, we will explore how to apply ensemble techniques, specifically bagging, boosting, and stacking, in time series prediction, models different from those conventionally used. We will use historical data of the daily closing price of Bancolombia shares to demonstrate how these methods can improve the accuracy of the models. We will compare the results obtained by each technique and discuss their advantages in financial analysis.
